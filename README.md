# Data-Science-Programming
This is the Assignment 1 of Data Science Programming. The Notebook contains 4 questions, for which we referred the internet for a few syntaxes. The code replicated in our notebook might be found anywhere on the internet and we in the best intrest of heart claim that we did not copy the code from that part.
